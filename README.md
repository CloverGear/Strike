Although this is a word guessing game, I only have five words in my vocabulary list, so the game isn't fun at all.
I watched way to many game jam videos and decided to join one one new year's eve. For the first time in my life, I stayed up all night working on this program. After a full 12 hour of working, I had a terrible headache, but was very satisfied with the game I made. However, I know people can do things that are 100 times better than me, and to avoid emotional damage, I did not submit my work.
